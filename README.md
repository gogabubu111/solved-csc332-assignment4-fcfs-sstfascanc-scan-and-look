Write a program that implements the following disk-scheduling algorithms:

<ol>

 <li>FCFS</li>

 <li>SSTF</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>SCAN</li>

</ul>

<ol>

 <li>C-SCAN</li>

 <li>LOOK</li>

</ol>

Your program will service a disk with 10,000 cylinders numbered 0 to 9,999. The program will generate a random series of 1,000 cylinders requests and service them according to each of the algorithms listed above. The program will be passed the initial position of the disk head (as a parameter on the command line), and report the total amount of head movement required by each algorithm. Your program should show the result in a table.




You may use any programming language and add comments to your code.

Submit the following:

<ol>

 <li>Your complete code with all comments</li>

 <li>Screenshot of the output</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>Assignment report which will answer the following questions:

  <ol>

   <li>Each algorithm definition</li>

   <li>The result (total amount of head movement) for each one algorithm</li>

   <li>Which algorithm is the most efficient one? Why?</li>

   <li></li>

  </ol></li>

</ul>
